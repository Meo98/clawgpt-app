## Content Rating Questionnaire Guidance

**Age Rating: 17+ / Mature**

Reasoning for the content rating questionnaire:
- The app itself contains no objectionable content
- However, it connects to AI services that can generate unrestricted text
- Users control their own AI configuration and content filtering
- Cannot guarantee AI responses are appropriate for all ages
- Recommend selecting "Yes" for user-generated content / user interaction
- Recommend selecting that content is not moderated

In the questionnaire:
- "Does your app contain user-generated content?" → Yes (AI responses vary)
- "Is this content moderated?" → No (user controls their own server)
- "Can users interact with each other?" → No
- Violence, sexual content, etc. → Select "Frequency: None" for app itself, but note AI responses are not controlled

This should result in a 17+ / Mature rating which is appropriate.
